Also make sure to have Support.v4 referenced in your Application project.\n\n## Creating the first Action Bar\nStart by creating a new Android Layout similar to this, lets call it `main.axml`:\n\n```\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- xmlns:ab must match your app namespace defined in AndroidManifest.xml --\u003e\n\u003cLinearLayout \n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:ab=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/legacybar.sample\"\n    android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n    android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\"\u003e\n\n    \u003clegacybar.library.bar.LegacyBar\n        android:id=\"@+id/actionbar\"\n        style=\"@style/actionbar\"\n        ab:title=\"Cool beans!\"/\u003e\n\n\u003c/LinearLayout\u003e\n```\n\nThen create a new `Activity` but instead of inheriting from `Activity` inherit from either of these:\n* `LegacyBarActivity`\n* `LegacyBarListActivity`\n* `LegacyBarFragmentActivity`\n\nThe classes above contain helpers and properties which makes it easier to use LegacyBar, however you can use LegacyBar from a normal `Activity` as well. In this example we are simply using `LegacyBarActivity`:\n\n```csharp\n[Activity(Label = \"Home Activity\", MainLauncher = true, LaunchMode = LaunchMode.SingleTop,\n        Icon = \"@drawable/icon\", Theme = \"@style/MyTheme\")]\npublic class HomeActivity : LegacyBarActivity\n{\n    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)\n    {\n        base.OnCreate(bundle);\n\n        // Set our view from the \"main.axml\" layout resource\n        SetContentView(Resource.Layout.main);\n        // Find LegacyBar and assign the value to the LegacyBar property\n        LegacyBar = FindViewById\u003cLibrary.Bar.LegacyBar\u003e(Resource.Id.actionbar);\n        // Set a nice home logo\n        LegacyBar.SetHomeLogo(Resource.Drawable.MyLogo);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe added a bit to the newly created `Activity`. After setting the `ContentView` you will notice that we are locating the `LegacyBar` `View` which is located in `main.axml` view we created just before. Then we have to set the `CurrentActivity` property in order for `LegacyBar` to be able to calculate positions in the `View` for menu items. Then we set a Home Logo.\n\nThat is it. You have created your first Activity with a LegacyBar! But wait we are not quite done yet, you will probably want to have some Actions up in the LegacyBar.\n\n## Adding Actions\nAdding Actions to the LegacyBar is pretty straight forward and has a couple of different ways to add Actions, Action and HomeActions. Let us start by adding one to the Home button, we created in the example above.\n\n### Home Actions\nIn the Base Activities we supply there is a nice helper method called `AddHomeAction` it supports two types of ways to use it. Either by supplying it with a `Type` of the `Activity` you want it to launch or an instance of `System.Action`.\n\n**1.**\nFirst way is to supply it with the `Type` of `Activity` you want to launch when pushing the button. This is simple you just do:\n\n```csharp\nAddHomeAction(typeof(MyOtherActivity), Resources.Drawable.MyLogo);\n```\n\nThis will launch `MyOtherActivity` when the Action is pressed, and the Home Action Icon will be presented with an arrow indicating navigation up the stack.\n\n**2.**\nThe other way is to supply it with an `System.Action` instance:\n\n```csharp\nAddHomeAction(() =\u003e \n              {\n                  //Your code here\n              }, Resource.Drawable.MyIcon, true);\n```\n\nThe `true` argument indicates that the arrow for the Home Action is shown.\n\n### Actions\nIn your Activity to add an Action to the LegacyBar we use the following code:\n\n```csharp\nvar search = new LegacyBarAction\n{\n    ActionType = ActionType.IfRoom,\n    Drawable =\n        LegacyBar.LightIcons\n            ? Resource.Drawable.ic_action_search\n            : Resource.Drawable.ic_action_search_dark,\n    PopUpMessage = Resource.String.ab_string_search\n};\n// Assign a click action\nsearch.Clicked += delegate { /* do an action when clicked */ };\n// Add it to the bar\nLegacyBar.AddAction(search);\n```\n\nYou will need to specify the Icon for the Action item, where you can check whether to use a Light or Dark version of the icon by checking `LegacyBar.LightIcons`, and also set the text representation for the item when it is shown in the overflow drop down or as a toast when long-pressed.\n\nThe `ActionType` defined is an `Enum` and the different enumerations are described as follows:\n\n* IfRoom - Dynamically calculates if the action can fit based on screen res\n* Always - Force it in the action bar no matter what\n* Never - Always put it in overflow (3.0+) or leave it in the old school menu bar.\n\nThe Action is then simply added with: `LegacyBar.AddAction(myItem);`.\n\n## Other Resources\n\n* [Our GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cheesebaron/LegacyBar)\n","Hash":"3cd87b881faf6871987d57a3e8c9c7e7","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
